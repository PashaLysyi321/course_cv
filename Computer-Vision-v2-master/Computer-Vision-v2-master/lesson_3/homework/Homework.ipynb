    "For this homework you are going to implement the **unsharp masking** filter (USM). It is a technique to improve the sharpness of an image by combining the image with its blurred (unsharp) version. See the Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsharp_masking) for more details.\n",

    "### Unsharp Masking (USP)\n",
    "The USM technique consists of the following steps:\n",
    "* Load the image you will be working with.\n",
    "* Create a blurred (unsharp) version of the original image.\n",
    "* Add the unsharp image (with a certain **weight**) to the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum it up, the USM performs the following operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sharpened = original + (original − unsharp) × amount`\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we provide you an image to work with, you are welcome to use your own images :-)"
