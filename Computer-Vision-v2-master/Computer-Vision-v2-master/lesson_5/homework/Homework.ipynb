    "In this homework you are going to implement the **Floyd-Steinberg dithering** algorithm. Dithering, in general, means that we are adding noise to the signal (in our case digital image) in order to perceive it better. In other words, by adding the noise the objective quality will be worse but the subjective quality will be better (i.e. the image will \"look\" better).\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of FS dithering can be found in this [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering) page. In order to implement the dithering, we will implement the following steps:\n",
    "* Define colour pallette\n",
    "* Quantize the image to obtain the baseline and compute the average quantization error\n",
    "* Implement FS dithering and compute the average quantization error\n",

    "You will also have to answer the question at the end of this notebook.\n",

    "Note: In this homework, you will have the chance to earn some extra points. See the \"Bonus\" section at the end of the notebook. Good luck!\n",
